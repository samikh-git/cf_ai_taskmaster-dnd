# User Prompts

## 2025-01-27

How do I read a .txt file in a cloudflare app?

I want to keep a system prompt for my agent in that file to remove bloat and have good formatting. How would you recommend to do that?

From now on, please add all of my prompts to you in a PROMPTS.md file.

Please remove context. Keep only the prompts.

Please improve the systemPromptDM in @agent/src/system_prompt.ts. Please ask me any quesitions that you may have.

1. Epic/Fantasy -- Like DND
2. It should be immersive.
3. The interaction style should be proactice. Try to immitate Tolkien's style. Should I provide a writing sample of Tolkien's to improve the output? 
4. XP is gained by the user completing the tasks that they set. This XP should be determined dynamically by the agent (no set rule but mroe complicated tasks should yield more XP and so forth)
5. They are going to be implemented. For now they are placeholders.
6. The DM does not need a name but try to maintain the fntasy touch.

Could you create a quick test script?

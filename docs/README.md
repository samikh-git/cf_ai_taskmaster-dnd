## Keeping Documentation Updated

When making changes:

1. **Update relevant docs** - Keep documentation in sync with code
2. **Add examples** - Include code examples for new features
3. **Update diagrams** - Keep architecture diagrams current
4. **Check links** - Verify all links work
5. **Review accuracy** - Ensure information is correct

## Need Help?

- Check the relevant documentation section
- Search existing issues
- Review code comments
- Ask in discussions

## Documentation Standards

- **Clear and concise** - Easy to understand
- **Up to date** - Reflects current codebase
- **Well-organized** - Logical structure
- **Examples included** - Code examples where helpful
- **Cross-referenced** - Links between related docs

## AI-Assisted Development

QuestMaster was developed with assistance from AI coding assistants (Cursor AI and Gemini AI). AI was used throughout the development process for:

- Code generation and implementation
- Architecture design and guidance
- Documentation writing and maintenance
- Debugging and problem-solving
- Testing and validation

The [AI Agent Guide](AGENTS.md) provides comprehensive documentation for AI assistants working on this codebase, reflecting the collaborative nature of this project.
